# Supercollider Explorations

Hi! I'm [gosub](https://github.com/gosub) and this repository is a collection of my music-coding wanderings in the fascinating land of [Supercollider](https://supercollider.github.io), a platform for synthesis, composition, and music experimentation in general.

Here you'll find a folder for every year in which I've wrote something in SuperCollider, and inside each folder an .scd file of every test, sketch, patch, experiment.

If you need help or want to discuss SuperCollider, live coding, music programming, electronic music (experimental and not) or whatever, feel free to contact me here on [github](https://github.com/gosub), via email [giampaolo.guiducci@gmail.com](mailto:giampaolo.guiducci@gmail.com) or on twitter [@nolente](https://twitter.com/nolente).
